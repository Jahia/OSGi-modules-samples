## How to use OSGi annotations in your module

In order for the OSGi annotations to work in your module, you need to make sure that you have this tag `<_dsannotations>*</_dsannotations>` in the `maven-bundle-plugin` plugin instructions of your pom.xml:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-bundle-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <instructions>
            <_dsannotations>*</_dsannotations>
        </instructions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```
