# This file is an example of a scope configuration file that can be used to define access control rules for an API in Jahia.
# It defines a scope called "sampleScope" that grants access to the "sampleApi" API
# for users with the "admin" permission.
# The scope is automatically applied to all requests.
# To go further and see more advanced configurations, please refer to the following page:
